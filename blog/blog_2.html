                            one of the best Because it is open source, you will not need to spend any money for it

                            If I talk about its features, what features are available in the linux, how it helps us and
                            makes us better from the window, then it has Portable, Open Source , Multi-User ,
                            Multiprogramming, Hierarchical File System Along with shell scripting, it also comes by
                            providing us security, if we look at the security, then there is neither any virus in short
                            in it nor it is a bit bad at all, it is very user friendly as Compared So look it is
                            according to the window

                        <h4>Can I Use The Linux Terminal On Android?</h4>
                        <p>Simple and simple yes because we know that our android device is based on the linux kernel,
                            so we just use all the commands of the linux on the terminal of our android rather we do not
                            make some terminals private in android which we linux can use a command but we have an app
                            which is Turmux. we can use basic commands of linux in the termux app also we can do
                            practice on our android device.

                            Here is the linux to install Termux in your android device (

                            1. pwd — When you first open the terminal, you are in the home directory of your user. To
                            know which directory you are in, you can use the “pwd” command.

                            2. ls — Use the "ls" command to know what files are in the directory you are in. You can see
                            all the hidden files by using the command “ls -a”.

                            3. cd — Use the "cd" command to go to a directory. For example, if you are in the home
                            folder, and you want to go to the downloads folder, then you can type in “cd Downloads”.

                            4. mkdir & rmdir — Use the mkdir command when you need to create a folder or a directory.

                            5. rm - Use the rm command to delete files and directories. Use "rm -r" to delete just the
                            directory. It deletes both the folder and the files it contains when using only the rm
                            command.
